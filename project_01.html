        <p class="subtitle">Understanding wind patterns on Mars is essential for 
          future human exploration and for advancing our knowledge of planetary 
          climate dynamics. Despite their importance, Martian winds remain largely 
          unknown. This project analyzes six image sequences from the Emirates Mars 
          Mission’s EXI 320 nm ultraviolet observations to derive detailed wind 
          field maps.<br>
          Using a cloud-tracking method called Correlation Image Velocimetry (CIV), 
          wind fields were calculated with time intervals of 10–30 minutes. 
          Various image pre-processing techniques were tested to optimize CIV 
          performance, with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) 
          producing the most reliable results.</p>

                This project involved multiple stages: literature review, data exploration, 
                data preparation, image processing, Correlation Image Velocimetry (CIV), 
                result analysis, and plotting. The raw data came in FITS files, 
                which were explored, prepared, and processed in Python using libraries such as 
                Astropy, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, NetCDF4, and scikit-learn. For the CIV, a 
                cross-correlation–based technique was executed in UVMAT, a MATLAB-based interface.

                The CIV workflow consisted of several steps: 
            </p>
            <ul class="subtitle">
                <li><strong>CIV1:</strong> Initial velocity fields were calculated using specified interrogation window and shift box parameters; the grid size defined the number of vectors displayed.</li>
                <li><strong>FIX1:</strong> Error correction and filtering of vectors above a pre-defined correlation coefficient.</li>
                <li><strong>PATCH1:</strong> Smoothness filtering through interpolation and determination of the maximum vector size.</li>
                <li><strong>CIV2, FIX2, PATCH2:</strong> The process was repeated using the vectors obtained from CIV1, allowing for refined parameter adjustments and accounting for rotation and deformation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Velocity fields were then exported and analyzed in Python, where final results were visualized and plotted 
                to provide detailed insights into Martian wind patterns. The project also included careful documentation 
                of methodology, results, and discussion, and was compiled as a thesis in LaTeX format.

                    The analysis of Martian wind fields revealed several key insights. While image processing 
                    techniques improved the visibility of clouds, they did not significantly outperform the 
                    original images. However, using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
                    allowed for the detection of additional velocity vectors, demonstrating the potential of 
                    enhancing sub-regions within the data. <br>
                    The choice of CIV parameters and input image material had a strong influence 
                    on the final results, showing that parameter tuning plays a critical role in deriving 
                    accurate velocity fields.<br>
                    The study also identified several limitations. These include uncertainties in 
                    vector direction due to the 3–4 km pixel resolution, variations in solar illumination, 
                    and potential spacecraft position instabilities.<br><br>
                    Finally, the work suggests promising future directions. Alternative pre-processing 
                    methods, particularly those focusing on sub-region enhancement, could further improve 
                    CIV performance. Additionally, the appearance of atmospheric wave patterns in 
                    high-pass filtered images points to opportunities for new insights into Martian 
                    atmospheric dynamics.
